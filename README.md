# 🏙️ SQL & Python Project: Analyzing Chicago Data

This repository contains hands-on labs and a final project completed as part of the **IBM “Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python”** course, part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The project focuses on exploring and analyzing real-world datasets from the city of Chicago using SQL and Python in Jupyter Notebooks.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The project uses real datasets to answer questions about:
- Socioeconomic conditions in Chicago neighborhoods
- Public school performance and progress reports
- Aggregating insights using SQL queries and Python

You’ll use `ibm_db` and `%sql` magic commands to interact with databases directly within a Jupyter Notebook environment.
